# Quick Civ 4

#### What is this?

A mod to make Civilization IV games drastically shorter, as well as a patcher tool to apply these same changes to other Civ 4 mods. The following mods have been tested to various degrees:

#### Installation

TODO

#### Changes

- Smaller maps: this change alone drastically reduces the length of the game
- Religion removed: one less system to worry about, not to mention religions in Civ 4 are all nearly identical
- Corporations removed: one less system to worry about, one that doesn't seem particularly engaging
- Non-governmental civics removed: this brings Civ 4 more in line with earlier Civ games which had different types of government but not multiple categories of civics to worry about
- Spy units removed: this removes destructive spy missions while still allowing for "passive" spy missions
- Some default game options have been changed as well in order to facilitate quicker games, but these can be adjusted when the game is started

#### Motivation

Civilization is one of my favourite game series of all time, but I'm not able to play it for hours on end like I used to do. I noticed there are some modern 4X games that are designed to be played quickly, so I tried The Battle of Polytopia. Unfortunately, while it looks a lot like Civ it didn't really feel like Civ. Rather than give up Civ altogether, I thought it would be a fun challenge to see how I could make it shorter.

#### Approach

First, where possible, the game options are relied upon; for example, instead of removing vassal states, it has been set to disabled by default in the game options. This allows players to enable it as desired.

One of the biggest factors in game speed is map size, and so this was the first major change as part of this mod.

Beyond that, I considered other systems that break the flow of the game when trying to play quickly and tried first to simplify them, and then if that wasn't possible I removed them.
