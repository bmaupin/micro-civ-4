#### Playing tips

1. Take the new map sizes into account when starting a game. For example, with the unmodded duel map size you could easily fit 5-6 players in the map, with this duel map size it can only realistically fit 2 players, tiny can only fit 3 players, etc.

1. When playing the game you may also want to make other adjustments. For example, with an unmodded map size one strategy is to build cities 4 tiles apart to maximise the number of tiles the city can work. With these modded map sizes, you'll probably want to build cities as close together as possible.
