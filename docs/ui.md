## Advisor buttons

#### Remove advisor button from UI

e.g. to remove the corporation, espionage, or religion advisor button from the top right in the UI:

â“˜ This was based on investigations of the included mods/scenarios but needs to be

- Modify Assets/Python/Screens/CvMainInterface.py

  - The buttons seem to be defined in `interfaceScreen`; removing or commenting this code should remove the corresponding advisor from the UI, e.g.

    ```python
    #iBtnX += iBtnAdvance
    #screen.setImageButton( "CorporationAdvisorButton", "", iBtnX, iBtnY, iBtnWidth, iBtnWidth, WidgetTypes.WIDGET_ACTION, gc.getControlInfo(ControlTypes.CONTROL_CORPORATION_SCREEN).getActionInfoIndex(), -1 )
    #screen.setStyle( "CorporationAdvisorButton", "Button_HUDAdvisorCorporation_Style" )
    #screen.hide(   "CorporationAdvisorButton" )
    ```

  - I've also seen this done by updating `updateMiscButtons` instead; for the corresponding button, comment or remove every instance of `screen.hide`, `screen.moveToFront`, or `screen.show`, e.g.

    ```python
    #screen.hide( "CorporationAdvisorButton" )
    #screen.show( "CorporationAdvisorButton" )
    #screen.moveToFront( "CorporationAdvisorButton" )
    ```

- This seems less common, but I've also seen it done by modifing `Assets/Python/EntryPoints/CvScreensInterface.py`

  - Modify the function to show the screen with an empty return, e.g.

    ```python
    def showReligionScreen():
        return
    ```

#### Research

- Afterworld: unclear since this mod is so drastically different; some buttons have been disabled in `Assets/Python/EntryPoints/CvScreensInterface.py` with an early `return` but not the advisor buttons
- Barbarians: buttons have been disabled in `Assets/Python/EntryPoints/CvScreensInterface.py` with an early `return`
- Broken Star: comments all instances of `screen.hide`, `screen.moveToFront`, or `screen.show` for `CorporationAdvisorButton`
- Charlemagne
  - Comments all instances of `screen.hide`, `screen.moveToFront`, or `screen.show` for `EspionageAdvisorButton`
  - `CorporationAdvisorButton` isn't in file
- Dune Wars: removes `screen.setImageButton` and surrounding code for `CorporationAdvisorButton`
- Final Frontier doesn't have any code for `CorporationAdvisorButton` in `Assets/Python/EntryPoints/CvScreensInterface.py`
- Mesoamerica comments `screen.setImageButton` and surrounding code for `CorporationAdvisorButton`
- Road to war: all `screen.show` instances for `CorporationAdvisorButton` have been set to `screen.hide` and `screen.moveToFront` has been commented out, but this leaves a gap where the corporation advisor button was
