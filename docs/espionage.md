# Espionage

#### For now, disable espionage by default

⚠️ For now espionage is disabled by setting it as disabled by default in the game options as this is low effort with the added advantage that it allows players to enable it if they wish. However, as per the [End of Espionage Mod](https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/end-of-espionage-mod.13540/), it seems that this effectively converts espionage points to culture points, which can end up making the game unbalanced.

## Later, simplify espionage or remove it altogether

#### Simplify espionage?

In earlier Civ games as well as Civ Rev, espionage consisted of a spy who could infiltrate enemy cities. Would it be possible to do something like this, just with XML changes? I'm not sure ...

For example, could we just remove espionage buildings, triggers, events, great people, etc. and just leave the spy unit?

#### Remove espionage altogether

If simplifying espionage isn't possible and disabling espionage in the game options ends up being problematic, a better approach may be to remove espionage altogether; this could potentially be done by removing espionage buildings, units, triggers, events, great people, etc.
