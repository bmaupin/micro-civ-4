# Ideas

#### Approach

- Start with the simplest approach first
  - Copy vendor files and modify them for a drop-in mod
  - Later if we settle on something we like we could create a map installation script
    - Maybe a Node script with a shebang? If there's demand we could compile it as an executable
- Base it on vanilla Civ 4 first
  - Expansions add more systems, units, technologies, etc, all of which will only make the games take longer
  - We could potentially re-base the mod on the new expansion packs later, which would be nice for more civilizations since they give more replayability without affecting game speed, but it would be take more work since there would be more to remove/disable
- Do an MVP first
  - Map size, espionage, religion?

#### To do

- [ ] Reduce map sizes
