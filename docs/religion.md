# Religion

#### To do

- [ ] Check the tech tree to see which religion comes first
- [ ] Try just commenting out one religion in CIV4ReligionInfo.xml to see the effect
  - Whichever comes first; Hinduism?

#### How to disable?

- Comment out the religion in CIV4ReligionInfo.xml?
  - Worth trying ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
  - It would probably be good to disable the buildings and units as well
  - We may need to also disable religious random events (if we don't just disable random events altogether)
- Remove the technology?
  - Each religion is founded by whichever civilization discovers that religion's technology first
  - Unfortunately this will be somewhat complex as the technologies are also
