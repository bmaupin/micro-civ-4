## Prior Civilization games

#### Religion

Religion wasn't a separate system in previous Civilization games. Instead it was broadly a category of buildings and/or technologies that typically gave an increase in happiness.

Religion as a separate system that would impact other civilisations' attitudes towards the player seems to be an innovation with Civ 4.

#### Espionage

Espionage in previous Civilization games was mostly limited to the spy unit, which was introduced in Civ 2. Espionage as a separate system with its own points seems to be an innovation with BtS.

#### Corporations

Corporations are a completely new addition to Civ, introduced in BtS.

#### Great people

Civ 3 introduced military and scientific leaders, which seems to be the precursor to great people, which were introduced in Civ 4.

#### Governments

Government types have existed in Civilization since the first game. However, this was expanded in Civ 4 to civics, which comprise five categories (including government civics) with five choices each.

#### Vassal states

Vassal states are a completely new addition to Civ, introduced in Warlords.

## Civilization Revolution

â“˜ In particular, these notes refer to the Nintendo DS release of Civilization Revolution. Other versions seem to be similar in terms of gameplay but with 3D instead of 2D graphics.

Civilization Revolution is a somewhat simplified version of Civilization released for consoles. Much of the changes made to Civ Rev as compared to other entries in the Civilization series seem to be made with the intention of making the game more easily playable on a console as well as to reduce the length of each game.

#### Similarities

While Civilization Revolution feels very different from Civ 4, in many ways it is much more similar to the core Civilization games when compared to earlier entries. This seems to be the case for systems such as religion, government types, and espionage, as well as systems that are not present in Civ Rev but that are present in Civ 4 such as corporations and vassal states.

Most of the other systems and items are very similar to earlier entries of the core Civilization games and rather than being drastically different, are mostly simplified or reduced.

#### Map size

As the map size is so closely correlated to the length of the game, the map size has been greatly reduced in Civ Rev. There is only one map size, which is 32 by 29 tiles. This is close to the size of the duel map in Civ 4 in terms of number of tiles, while still being a tad smaller.

#### Victory conditions

Victory conditions in Civ Rev deviate from the core Civilization series. There are no conquest or diplomatic victories, but a new victory type (economic) was introduced and the remaining victory types have been simplified. For example, a domination victory only requires capturing the capitals of the other civilisations.

#### Religion

Religion in Civ Rev has more in common with the earlier versions of Civilization than it does Civ 4; there are no religions in Civ Rev to speak of, neither are there religious units or wonders. Instead, there are two religious buildings, each which give extra culture. In addition, there is a _Religion_ technology, but this merely serves to unlock one of the religious buildings.

#### Government types

Similar to religion, government types in Civ Rev also have more in common with earlier versions of Civilization where there were a set amount of government types (five in Civ Rev) to choose from, whereas Civ 4 has five groups of civics with five choices each.

#### Espionage

Yet again, espionage in Civ Rev has more in common with earlier versions of Civilization than it does Civ 4. Espionage is not a separate system with its own buildings and points, but instead consists of one unit (the spy), who can go to another civilisation's city to conduct espionage missions.

#### Units, buildings, technologies, wonders, etc.

Many of these are exactly as found in the core Civilization games, however the number of each of these has been reduced.

One notable exception is that Civ Rev does not have worker units. Roads are instead built from the city menu as one would normally build a unit, building, or wonder.

## The Battle of Polytopia

The Battle of Polytopia is in some ways the 4X genre distilled to the bare essentials. All of the 4X elements are there but the number of systems has been drastically reduced, as well as the number of elements within each system (units, technologies, etc).

#### Similarities

Before delving into differences, there are many similarities between Polytopia and Civilization. Like Civilization, Polytopia does indeed have each of the requisite gameplay conventions of a 4X game: players can explore the map, expand their territory, exploit the resources of the terrain, and if they wish, exterminate their enemies.

Polytopia has many of the same base components that make up Civilization, such as a map that represents a large area split up by tiles, terrain features, cities, roads, technologies, as well as units and buildings which are produced by cities.

#### Game sessions

From a very high level, Polytopia is designed to be played in one sitting. There's not even a way to save the progress of a single-player game (although multiplayer games can be saved).

#### Victory conditions ("game modes")

Polytopia essentially has two victory conditions: time ("perfection") and domination.

Unlike Civilization, the time victory condition can be fairly satisfying, as the game shows you at every turn how many turns are left and so the end of the game doesn't come as a surprise.

#### Civilisations ("tribes")

Aside from the premium civilisations (which must be purchased separately from the base game), each civilisation is essentially the same. The only gameplay differences are that each civilisation starts with a different technology and unit, however neither of these are unique to that civilisation. Aside from that, all other differences are aesthetic: the music for each civilisation is different, as well as the appearance of units, buildings, and land tiles.

#### Eras

Polytopia does not have proper eras although there is a limited sense of progression through the different technologies, which span from ancient to medieval eras. At the beginning of the game, units are primitive and equipped with clubs. More advanced (knights, catapults, etc) can be acquired toward the end of the technology branches.

Beyond that, cities change only in relation to their population and there are no other aesthetic or gameplay changes due to progression through eras.

#### Map sizes

One of the most impactful differences in regards to the length of Polytopia games is map sizes. Maps range from 11 by 11 to 30 by 30 tiles, all of which have fewer total tiles than even the smallest map in Civ 4 (the duel-size map).

#### Resources

Civilization has a number of resources that must be managed, including production, science, and gold.

Polytopia essentially has one resource: stars. Stars are used to build units and buildings, purchase technologies, and to modify the terrain. Stars are generated from each city based on its population, as well as through other means such as specific buildings or peace treaties with other civilisations.

By having just one resource, the gameplay is vastly simplified. In Civilization, a lot of time is spent managing and balancing resources, whereas in Polytopia, this time can instead be spent interacting with the other systems the game has to offer.

#### Cities

Unlike Civilization, in Polytopia cities are not built, rather they are discovered and captured. This makes the game much quicker as settler units don't need to be first built and settler units aren't even in the game.

#### Espionage

Espionage in Polytopia essentially consists of a spy unit (called a "cloak") which can infiltrate enemy cities.

#### Diplomacy

Diplomacy in Polytopia has a few different aspects. First is the status with other civilisations, which can be at war, neutral, or peace. A peace treaty is required to be at peace with another civilisation, and sending a peace treaty requires unlocking a specific technology.

In addition, a separate technology reveals the capitals of all discovered civilisations and allows building an embassy in the capital of another civilisation, which gives each civilisation extra stars per turn.

The most advanced aspect of diplomacy only applies to AI players, which will have an attitude towards you based on a number of factors, such as how powerful you are, whether or not you are or have been at war or at peace with them, how close your borders are, whether you have an embassy in their capital, as well as your relationship with other civilisations.

#### Borders

The borders of a civilisation consist of the tiles immediately surrounding each city in that civilisation. Borders do not grow as in Civilization, instead when a city reaches a certain size the player will be given the choice to expand the borders of a city or the population.

Movement within borders of other civilisations is unrestricted. Instead, borders only seem to have minimal impact to the gameplay; if you break a peace treaty, units within the enemy's borders will be removed from the game, and if your borders are too close to an AI civilisation it will negatively impact their attitude towards you.

#### Wonders ("monuments")

Polytopia doesn't have wonders the same way that Civilization does. In Polytopia, there is a handful of special buildings called monuments that can only be built once per civilisation. Unlike Civilization, each monument can be built by each civilisation. Monuments in Polytopia also only have a one-time effect, which is normally a population and point increase.

#### Combat

Combat in Polytopia is similar to Civilization but simplified. Units have hit points and can attain veteran status after a certain amount of combat. Only one unit can be on a tile at a time.

#### Religion, corporations, government types, civics, culture, etc.

None of these systems exist in Polytopia. Other minor gameplay systems are also absent (happiness, health, maintenance, etc).
