## Civilization Revolution DS

Civilization Revolution DS (hereafter referred to as Civ Rev), while drastically different from other entries in the Civilization series, still feels very much like a Civilization game and is much more like Civilization IV than Battle of Polytopia.

#### Similarities

Unlike Battle of Polytopia (hereafter referred to as Polytopia), Civ Rev tends to have more similarities than differences as compared to the core Civilization games. Most of the major systems from Civilization are present; although many of them are simplified or reduced to make the game more easily playable on a console as well as to reduce the length of each game.

#### Map size

As the map size is so closely correlated to the length of the game, the map size has been greatly reduced in Civ Rev. There is only one map size, which is 32 by 29 tiles. This is close to the size of the duel map in Civilization IV in terms of number of tiles, while still being a tad smaller.

#### Victory conditions

Victory conditions in Civ Rev are simplified; _Domination_ requires capturing only the capitals of the other civilisations, _Culture_ requires a total of 20 great persons, wonders, or converted cities; _Economic_ requires 20,000 gold and a wonder, and _Technological_ requires reaching Alpha Centauri.

#### Religion

Religion in Civ Rev is one of the biggest changes from Civilization. There are no religions to speak of, neither are there religious units or wonders. Instead, there are two religious buildings, each which give extra culture. In addition, there is a _Religion_ technology, but this merely serves to unlock one of the religious buildings.

#### Government types

Civilization IV has five groups of civics with five choices each. Civ Rev instead has five government types to choose from.

#### Espionage

Espionage is also greatly simplified as compared to Civilization IV. It essentially consists of one unit (the spy), who can go to another civilisation's city to conduct espionage missions. There are no espionage buildings or points as in Civilization IV.

#### Units, buildings, technologies, wonders, etc.

Many of these are exactly as found in the core Civilization games, however the number of each of these has been reduced.

One notable exception is that Civ Rev does not have worker units. Roads are instead built from the city menu as one would normally build a unit, building, or wonder.

## The Battle of Polytopia

The Battle of Polytopia (hereafter referred to as Polytopia) is in some ways the 4X genre distilled to the bare essentials. All of the 4X elements are there but the number of systems has been drastically reduced, as well as the number of elements within each system (units, technologies, etc).

#### Similarities

Before delving into differences, there are many similarities between Polytopia and Civilization. Like Civilization, Polytopia does indeed have each of the requisite gameplay conventions of a 4X game: players can explore the map, expand their territory, exploit the resources of the terrain, and if they wish, exterminate their enemies.

Polytopia has many of the same base components that make up Civilization, such as a map that represents a large area split up by tiles, terrain features, cities, roads, technologies, as well as units and buildings which are produced by cities.

#### Game sessions

From a very high level, Polytopia is designed to be played in one sitting. There's not even a way to save the progress of a single-player game (although multiplayer games can be saved).

#### Victory conditions ("game modes")

Polytopia essentially has two victory conditions: time ("perfection") and domination.

Unlike Civilization, the time victory condition can be fairly satisfying, as the game shows you at every turn how many turns are left and so the end of the game doesn't come as a surprise.

#### Civilisations ("tribes")

Aside from the premium civilisations (which must be purchased separately from the base game), each civilisation is essentially the same. The only gameplay differences are that each civilisation starts with a different technology and unit, however neither of these are unique to that civilisation. Aside from that, all other differences are aesthetic: the music for each civilisation is different, as well as the appearance of units, buildings, and land tiles.

#### Eras

Polytopia does not have proper eras although there is a limited sense of progression through the different technologies, which span from ancient to medieval eras. At the beginning of the game, units are primitive and equipped with clubs. More advanced (knights, catapults, etc) can be acquired toward the end of the technology branches.

Beyond that, cities change only in relation to their population and there are no other aesthetic or gameplay changes due to progression through eras.

#### Map sizes

One of the most impactful differences in regards to the length of Polytopia games is map sizes. Maps range from 11 by 11 to 30 by 30 tiles, all of which have fewer total tiles than even the smallest map in Civilization IV (the duel-size map).

#### Resources

Civilization has a number of resources that must be managed, including production, science, and gold.

Polytopia essentially has one resource: stars. Stars are used to build units and buildings, purchase technologies, and to modify the terrain. Stars are generated from each city based on its population, as well as through other means such as specific buildings or peace treaties with other civilisations.

By having just one resource, the gameplay is vastly simplified. In Civilization, a lot of time is spent managing and balancing resources, whereas in Polytopia, this time can instead be spent interacting with the other systems the game has to offer.

#### Cities

Unlike Civilization, in Polytopia cities are not built, rather they are discovered and captured. This makes the game much quicker as settler units don't need to be first built and settler units aren't even in the game.

#### Espionage

Espionage in Polytopia essentially consists of a spy unit (called a "cloak") which can infiltrate enemy cities.

#### Diplomacy

Diplomacy in Polytopia has a few different aspects. First is the status with other civilisations, which can be at war, neutral, or peace. A peace treaty is required to be at peace with another civilisation, and sending a peace treaty requires unlocking a specific technology.

In addition, a separate technology reveals the capitals of all discovered civilisations and allows building an embassy in the capital of another civilisation, which gives each civilisation extra stars per turn.

The most advanced aspect of diplomacy only applies to AI players, which will have an attitude towards you based on a number of factors, such as how powerful you are, whether or not you are or have been at war or at peace with them, how close your borders are, whether you have an embassy in their capital, as well as your relationship with other civilisations.

#### Borders

The borders of a civilisation consist of the tiles immediately surrounding each city in that civilisation. Borders do not grow as in Civilization, instead when a city reaches a certain size the player will be given the choice to expand the borders of a city or the population.

Movement within borders of other civilisations is unrestricted. Instead, borders only seem to have minimal impact to the gameplay; if you break a peace treaty, units within the enemy's borders will be removed from the game, and if your borders are too close to an AI civilisation it will negatively impact their attitude towards you.

#### Wonders ("monuments")

Polytopia doesn't have wonders the same way that Civilization does. In Polytopia, there is a handful of special buildings called monuments that can only be built once per civilisation. Unlike Civilization, each monument can be built by each civilisation. Monuments in Polytopia also only have a one-time effect, which is normally a population and point increase.

#### Combat

Combat in Polytopia is similar to Civilization but simplified. Units have hit points and can attain veteran status after a certain amount of combat. Only one unit can be on a tile at a time.

#### Religion, corporations, governments, civics, culture, etc.

None of these systems exist in Polytopia. Other minor gameplay systems are also absent (happiness, health, maintenance, etc).
