# Civics

#### Simplify civics?

In previous versions of Civilization, including Civ Rev, civics were limited to government types. Would it be possible to remove other civic types in Civ 4?

#### ~~Alternate idea: remove favourite civics of each civ~~

This would remove the annoying proclivity to hostility if yours doesn't match.

... but then the game would still interrupt you every time you discover a new civic, which is annoying when trying to play quickly.

#### Remove civics

1. Remove a civic option

   â“˜ Civic options are categories of civics. If you want to remove an entire category of civics (e.g. religion), do this step first, then for the next step remove every civic corresponding to the removed civic option. If you just want to remove an individual civic, skip this step.

   1. Remove the corresponding civic option from [Assets/XML/GameInfo/CIV4CivicOptionInfos.xml](../src/Assets/XML/GameInfo/CIV4CivicOptionInfos.xml)
   1. Remove any other items (e.g. buildings) with that same civic option

1. Remove the civic from the game

   1. Remove or comment out civic from [Assets/XML/GameInfo/CIV4CivicInfos.xml](../src/Assets/XML/GameInfo/CIV4CivicInfos.xml)
   1. Replace corresponding `CivicType` in [Assets/XML/Civilizations/CIV4CivilizationInfos.xml](../src/Assets/XML/Civilizations/CIV4CivilizationInfos.xml) with `NONE`, e.g.

   ```xml
   <CivicType>NONE</CivicType>
   ```

   1. Replace corresponding `FavoriteCivic` in [Assets/XML/Civilizations/CIV4LeaderHeadInfos.xml](../src/Assets/XML/Civilizations/CIV4LeaderHeadInfos.xml) with `<FavoriteCivic>NONE</FavoriteCivic>`

      - Replace

        ```
        (<FavoriteCivic>.*</FavoriteCivic>)
        ```

        with

        ```
        <!--$1-->
              <FavoriteCivic>NONE</FavoriteCivic>
        ```

   1. Remove or comment out events with matching `Civic` in [Assets/XML/Events/CIV4EventTriggerInfos.xml](../src/Assets/XML/Events/CIV4EventTriggerInfos.xml)
   1. Remove or comment out vote infos with matching `CivicType` from [Assets/XML/GameInfo/CIV4VoteInfo.xml](../src/Assets/XML/GameInfo/CIV4VoteInfo.xml)
